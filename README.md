# personal-certificates-gallery

This project is a web page that works as a carousel image gallery to show the certificates that I have acquired in my studies in programming and computer engineering.

The page is still under development and still needs a lot of improvements.

In the future I'd like to add a section to talk about non-certificate courses I've taken, adjust the page for better user interaction with a better responsive design, and turn the entire carousel into a decoupled, reusable web component.
